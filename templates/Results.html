  <p class="ymca-intro">After exploratory Data Analysis, we have a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of these three programs of YMCA.
    YMCA creates opportunities for people to improve their lives and their communities. Through empowering
    young people, improving individual and community well-being, and inspiring action aimed to create meaningful
    change across the country.</p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <label for="handle1">Physical Learning Activities for Youth (PLAY)</label>
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        From Analysis, we found that the participants who participated in the PLAY generally showed great enthusiasm for physical
        activities, which indeed help with children's health. Also, since 10 YMCA branches carry out PLAY in surrounding schools,
        concentrated in coastal areas, we reasonably guess that the number of participants in the PLAY program may be related to
        the number of local schools and branches, the population, and the district's location (the distance from the downtown).
        This may be a problem that needs to be considered when selecting a site for YMCA: YMCA can choose a site closer to the urban
        area or more populous school district, which will help the promotion of the program. When YMCA is designing PLAY activities,
        they do not need to conduct the activities too frequently but to increase the depth and efficiency of each single daily activity.

      <label for="handle2">Youth & Government (Y&G)</label>
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p> From our previous analysis, we found that most participants think that the program has helped them develop their
        college-level skills and employability skills, which confirmed that the effect of this program is significant. Meanwhile,
        the positive attitude of voting of participants from the vote distribution also confirmed that the program helps youth become
        civically engaged and it plays a great role in improving their social responsibility. But while most of the participants had
        volunteered or had public meetings, there were some execution and teamwork (leadership) issues, such as less than half of
        them have worked with others to improve a condition in their neighborhoods. This is a problem that needs to be solved by the
        youth and government program in the future, in order for youth to strengthen their communities as well as contribute to society.</p>

    </h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Every graduate from the Youth Institute has been accepted and enrolled in
        an accredited college/university. From Analysis, we found that both new participants and returning participants
        all acquire the knowledge of written skills at various levels. We also found that returning participants are more
        skilled in organizing and discriminating information, and the returning participants have decreased in the
        number of no skills level on each social media skill set, which confirmed that YIMA indeed helps youth with
        their higher education readiness, and improve their social media skills level. In general, the vast majority of
        new participants said they would recommend the YIMA program to their peers, which suggests that for new
        participants, the YIMA program can help them improve themselves effectively. YMCA YIMA can intensify its
        promotion efforts so that this program can help more young students.</p>

    <h1>Limitations</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to the time limit, we focused more on the given datasets. If we have more time, we will look for and take other datasets into
        account to further support our conclusion. For example, we could look for a supplemental survey dataset to analyze more details about
        the student background knowledge set before entering each program.</li>
      <li>There might be some differences in teaching resources and mentor friendliness between YMCA branches in different regions. Also,
        there might be some unique individual variations student by student in background knowledge, learning effectiveness, and future plan
        that may affect their feeling about the programs.  Since we lack data and it would be too complicated to take these into account,  we
        choose to ignore those differences.</li>
      <li>To further support our conclusion, it is better to have a larger sample size. However, the dataset that we looked into has a
        very small data size, which is lower than 50. In this case, we may have to settle for less conclusive results. If we have more
        samples, some of our conclusions might have changed. This is hard to say at this moment.</li>

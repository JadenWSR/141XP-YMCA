# UCLA Stats 141XP-YMCA Research Project

We are a group of senior UCLA undergraduate students(graduating in 2022) with a major in Statistics. This Website is built for our milestone project in Stats 141XP, Practice of Statistical Consulting. In this course, our group will solve real data analysis problems for our wonderful community-based client, Khathy Hoang from YMCA. The aim of this app is to demonstrate our analysis results of the YMCA data achieved from dashboards created by using Tableau, a popular data visualization tool.
